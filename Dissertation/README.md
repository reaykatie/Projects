# Exploring the Hedonic Detector: is an inappropriate setting of the neutral point aetiologically implicated in depression?

## What is Working Memory?
The Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory (WM; Baddeley and Hitch, 1974) is one of the most enduring and empirically supported models of cognition and memory (Logie & Cowan, 2015), with robust corroborative data originating in cognitive, developmental, and neuropsychological research, and theoretical support arising from computational models (Baddeley, 2000; Becker, 1994; Burgess & Hitch, 2005; de Ribaupierre & Hitch, 1994; Smith & Jonides, 1995, 1997). According to the Baddeley and Hitch model, WM is the basis of conscious thought, acting as a space in which representations of internal and external stimuli may be temporarily activated and manipulated by attentional control processes and accessed via consciousness (Baddeley, 2013). The Baddeley and Hitch model of WM comprises multiple main components, which are then fractionated into subcomponents. The model is semi-modular, in that these subcomponents are proposed to be functionally specialised, but necessarily interactive (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974; Baddeley, 1983, 1996, 2000, 2012). 

## How is motivation incorporated into Working Memory?
Baddeley’s proposal for the role of motivation in the WM model is theoretically rooted in Hume’s Valenced World Hypothesis (Baddeley, 2013; Hume, 1978). Hume addressed the issue of motivation by proposing that while cognitive functions control actions, actions are directed in accordance with ‘the passions’, by which he meant predispositions, feelings, and desires. Hume defined the passions in terms of their bifurcated associated prospects of pleasure or displeasure, their ‘valence’ (Hume, 1978). He proposed that the world comprises a range of stimuli, each with associated possible actions and valences, which are assessed in light of the individual’s long-term temperament, present emotional state, and current intentions. Assessment of a stimulus as a probable cause of pleasure incentivises the associated possible actions; contrapositively, assessment of it as causative of displeasure disincentivises them. If we, like Baddeley, are to conceptualise motivation in terms of Humean ‘valence’ and ‘passions’, our model of cognition needs to be capable of valence processing, storage, and integration with information about temperament, emotional states, and current intentions from other subsystems and long-term memory. Baddeley proposes that a new WM component, the ‘Hedonic Detector’, fulfils this function (Baddeley, 2007).

## The Hedonic Detector Hypothesis
The hedonic detector is proposed to process and store valence as a representation of its positivity or negativity and its intensity.  

  The hedonic detector is proposed to be defined by five core features (Baddeley, 2013):
  1. A neutral point, over which valences are assessed as positive and under which they are assessed as negative,
  2. The capacity to detect positive and negative valences,
  3. The capacity to average them to compute a mean hedonic signal,
  4. The capacity to store mean hedonic signals,
  5. And the capacity to compare them.

All of these features are likely to be affected by depression (Baddeley, 2013). While the effects of depression on stages (3), (4), and (5) of valence processing are likely to be considerable, these stages are extensively interactive with long term memory, which is itself known to be pervasively affected by depression, and so the specific effects of putative depression-related abnormalities in the hedonic detector would be difficult to empirically isolate in these stages. A purer approach to examining the effects of depression on the hedonic detector may be to focus on stage (1), the setting of the neutral point.

We propose that depression may be partially caused by a malfunction in the hedonic detector, specifically the setting of the neutral point abnormally and maladaptively high, such that stimuli that would usually be neutral are interpreted to be negative (Baddeley et al., 2012). The neutral point is supposed to be set partially by genetic factors like long-term temperament, physiological factors like endocrine fluctuations, or even pharmacological factors like antidepressant medication, but also in part by experience (Baddeley, 2007), and therefore depression-related cognitive biases may in time shift the hedonic neutral point. Thus the inappropriate setting of the neutral point may be implicated as both a predisposing and maintaining factor in depression.

## The Present Research
The present research aims to investigate the effect of depression on the setting of the postulated hedonic detector neutral point. One of the assumptions underpinning the hedonic detector hypothesis is that hedonic tone or mood will influence the neutral point, with the result that a negative mood will result in a previously neutral event being perceived as negative. Baddeley et al. (2012) devised and started to evaluate a quasi-perceptual task that requires participants to make valence assessments of words or faces, and proposed that this measure, if validated, could be used to assess the hedonic detector neutral point. Baddeley et al. (2012) found that induction of a positive or negative mood shifted the neutral point of the hedonic detector, acting as a biasing signal in the subsequent assessment of stimuli. However, the conclusions of this experiment could not be confidently extended to the potential effects of depression on the hedonic detector neutral point, both because their population was small and homogeneous and the effect was of induced rather than naturalistic moods. As such, the aims of the present study are to replicate Baddeley et al. (2012) in a far larger and heterogeneous population and to use naturalistic moods rather than induced ones.

## Hypotheses
We hypothesise that, while controlling for gender, age, stress, and comorbid anxiety, participants’ depression scores will be associated with:

1. Their hedonic detector neutral point. 
We predict that as depression level increases the neutral point will be set progressively higher, which will result in more negative    valence assessments, manifested in more negative responses in the quasi-perceptual test. We will examine this with linear regression. 

2. Their hedonic detector lability. We predict that as depression level increases, valence assessments will become more extreme,     manifested in greater overall deviation from the normative mean in the quasi-perceptual test. The model proposes that valence assessment is a WM function, and so we predict that responses in the quasi-perceptual test will be affected by depression-related constraints on WM capacity, which we theorise may manifest in more absolutist responses. We will examine this with linear regression.
